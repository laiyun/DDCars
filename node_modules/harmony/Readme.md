# Harmony

Because parsing forms shouldn't be hard.

## Parsing forms, especially uploads, is confusing.

Node.js, and the Connect middleware framework is uncharted territory for most developers. This module makes form parsing easy (by exposing lower-level API's, not manipulating them), and helps keep your form parsing code DRY.

This module borrows a lot of [TJ Holowaychuk](http://tjholowaychuk.com/)'s [connect-form](http://github.com/visionmedia/connect-form/), but aims to provide a more flexible API, allowing you to easily parse multi-file uploads, and other advanced submissions.
